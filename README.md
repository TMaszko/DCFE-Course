# DeftCode's Front-end Course

Hi,
My name is Pawe≈Ç and I've created this course for you guys (and girls) because of three reasons:

1. **Bad experience** - I've wasted about year of my life working for company I should not, or better, in a way I should not work. Company where more important was quantity not quality of products. There was no one less or more experienced than me, no one to tell me that I'm doing something right or wrong and from experience I know that this is biggest mistake we can make. We need more experienced people around us, we need code reviews and we can't be afraid to ask questions, even the dumbest ones.

2. **People** - Yes, people. This is the reason why front-end development even exist, isn't it? Without people creating free, open source solutions, without people creating articles, tutorials and free content imagine how hard it would be for all of us to learn front-end development these days, when everything is changing so fast. So believe me if I say that we're not the ones responsible for our success but people around us, so respect each other.

3. **Knowledge** - I don't know everything, I'm not even in half-way to knowing everything. I'm making mistakes, I'm learning everyday. This is the third reason I'm creating this course for you guys (and girls) - to learn. Because to be able to teach you first I need to be sure I know certain topics perfectly and even after proper preparing I know there can be questions for which I will not know answer. But I will be happy to find those answers for you and me.

To get started just fork this repository and add me as collaborator. Then when doing exercises for every exercise create proper branch for example:

When you have done exercise just create Pull Request to master branch and assign me to it.
